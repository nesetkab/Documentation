# Setup your Localizer

---
## Define your localizer
1. Go to your class with a `static{}` block, where you will be changing your FollowerConstants (In the Quickstart, this class is called `FConstants`).
2. Once there, type this, where [LOCALIZER] is your localizer of choice:
```java 
    FollowerConstants.localizers = Localizers.[LOCALIZER];
```

3. The default is THREE_WHEEL, you will not have to do this step if you are using three wheel, as it is the default.

## Define your motor names and directions
1. Navigate to `FConstants` and into the `static{}` block
2. Modify your hardware map names for your motors and the directions of your motors. The defaults are: 

```java
FollowerConstants.leftFrontMotorName = "leftFront";
FollowerConstants.leftRearMotorName = "leftRear";
FollowerConstants.rightFrontMotorName = "rightFront";
FollowerConstants.rightRearMotorName = "rightRear";

FollowerConstants.leftFrontMotorDirection = DcMotorSimple.Direction.REVERSE;
FollowerConstants.leftRearMotorDirection = DcMotorSimple.Direction.REVERSE;
FollowerConstants.rightFrontMotorDirection = DcMotorSimple.Direction.FORWARD;
FollowerConstants.rightRearMotorDirection = DcMotorSimple.Direction.FORWARD;
```

## Access
To begin setting up your localizer, go to your class with a `static{}` block, where you will be changing your Localizer's constants (In the Quickstart, this class is called `LConstants`).

From there, continue the steps for your localizer in the linked pages:
- [Drive Encoder Localizer](driveEncoder.md)
- [Two Wheel Localizer](twoWheel.md)
- [Three Wheel Localizer](threeWheel.md)
- [Three Wheel + IMU Localizer](threeWheelImu.md)
- [OTOS Localizer](otos.md)
- [Pinpoint Localizer](pinpoint.md)
